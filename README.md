# dp-from-scratch

The main idea of this project bridging the gap between the networds in  [Andrews NG's course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
to the standards of [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) and 
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/). In pursuing this 
purpose, the repo [ML-from scratch](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/ML-From-Scratch) Erik Lindernoren 
has been a great resource, I really recommend it as general background.
